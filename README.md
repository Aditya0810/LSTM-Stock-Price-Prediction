This mini project aims to use LSTM models with varying epoch sizes to predict stock prices of any ticker symbol listed on the NASDAQ. The project is built using the Streamlit
framework, and allows the user to either use a LSTM model or an ARIMA model, both two different ways to make predictions. This was an interesting opportunity to explore different
predictive models and their behavior with a subject as complicated as stock prices.
